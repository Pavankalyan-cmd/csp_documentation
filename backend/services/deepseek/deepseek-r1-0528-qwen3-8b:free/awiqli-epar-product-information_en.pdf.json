They want me to extract all relevant information from a given text about a medicinal product called Awiqli. The instructions are quite detailed, requiring thoroughness and ensuring no fields are marked as \"Not found\" unless absolutely certain.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the correct fields to extract. The user has specified a list of fields, including filename, Document Type, Product Name, Active Substance(s), Strength, Pharmaceutical Form, Route of Administration, and many more. Each field has detailed search instructions. My main task is to systematically go through each field, searching the entire provided text for any relevant information.\n\nStarting with the filename, the text mentions \"filename: awiqli-epar-product-information_en.pdf\" at the very beginning. So, extracting \"awiqli-epar-product-information_en.pdf\" is straightforward.\n\nFor Document Type, the term \"Summary of Product Characteristics\" is repeated several times in the text, and the document starts with \"ANNEX I\" labeled as \"SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\". That's a clear match.\n\nProduct Name: The text lists the product as \"Awiqli 700 units/mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen\" multiple times. So, the product name is \"Awiqli\".\n\nActive Substance(s): The 2nd section explicitly lists the active substance as \"insulin icodec\".\n\nStrength: The text provides multiple strengths in different pre-filled pens: 700 units, 1050 units, 2100 units. Each corresponding to 1mL, 1.5mL, 3mL solutions, respectively.\n\nPharmaceutical Form is clearly stated as \"solution for injection in pre-filled pen\". Route of Administration mentions \"subcutaneous use\" multiple times.\n\nIndications list \"Treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults.\" The posology section elaborates on the dosing.\n\nContraindications list \"Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\" There are numerous sections on special warnings and precautions, including hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, storage conditions, etc.\n\nPackaging details include various pre-filled pen capacities and needle counts. The Storage Conditions are detailed as per the text.\n\nI need to ensure that I capture all related information for each field, like strengths for different formulations, potential contraindications, and the various manufacturers if mentioned. The instructions emphasize extracting all details without omitting any partial information.\n\nI also need to check for synonyms or variations in the field definitions. For example, \"ATC Code\" is given as \"A10AE07\" in section 5.1. Other details like Marketing Authorisation Holder are clear with \"Novo Nordisk A/S\" as the holder.\n\nOne challenge is ensuring that all sections of the document are covered, including the annexes which provide additional details on storage, packaging, and legal categories. The extensive text requires careful reading, but the structured fields help in systematic extraction.\n\nDouble-checking each field against the text is crucial. For example, confirming that all mentioned manufacturers and excipients are captured, and that dates like the Date of First Authorisation are correctly extracted (\"17 May 2024\").\n\nI must ensure that the extracted information adheres to the specified format, using semicolons to separate multiple entries when necessary. For instance, in the Strength field, listing all the different units per mL.\n\nOverall, the key is maintaining thoroughness in scanning each part of the document, leveraging all given search instructions to cover every possible data point, and ensuring no field remains without an extracted value unless confirmed as absent.\n"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":31192,"completion_tokens":1325,"total_tokens":32517}}
