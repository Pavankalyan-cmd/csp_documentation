This is definitely more complex than a standard extract because the text is structured as a summary of product characteristics for a drug called Awiqli, which contains insulin icodec. \n\nOkay, first I need to unpack what the user actually wants here. They provided both a detailed set of field specifications and a very thorough set of instructions about how to approach the extraction. The core task is to extract all information for each specified field from the given text. \n\nLooking at the text, I notice it's a massive document with multiple sections: introduction, composition, clinical particulars, pharmacological properties, pharmaceutical particulars, marketing info, etc. The level of detail is impressive - it even includes package leaflet content and storage instructions. \n\nFirst impression is this is going to require extremely careful scanning of the document. The user wants EVERYTHING, so I can't just pick the obvious fields. I need to systematically go through each section and pull out any relevant information for all fields, even if some might appear in unexpected places like headers or footers.\n\nThe format is very structured. Each section is clearly labeled, which is helpful. Starting with the document type and product name seems straightforward. The 'Summary of Product Characteristics' is explicitly stated in the document title. For the product name, it appears as both 'Awiqli' and 'insulin icodec' throughout the document.\n\nLooking at the filename field, the document path is given at the very beginning as 'filename: awiqli-epar-product-information_en.pdf'. So that's clear.\n\nFor active substances, it's straightforward from the composition section. The astute observation here is that while the product is branded Awiqli, the active substance is still called insulin icodec.\n\nThe strength is given multiple times, but it's clear that it comes in different concentrations (700, 1050, 2100 units) and is packaged in various pen sizes (1mL, 1.5mL, 3mL). This means I need to document all variations.\n\nPharmaceutical form is clearly multiple formats - solution for injection in pre-filled pen, but also specifies the FlexTouch type when mentioned.\n\nRoute of administration is consistently reported across sections. Indications are clearly stated just applies to type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n\nPosology section is very detailed. This requires extracting not just the basic posology but also the specialized instructions for switching from other insulins, handling missed doses, etc.\n\nThe contraindications are clearly stated only relates to hypersensitivity. Special warnings and precautions span multiple sections - hypoglycaemia is a major risk mentioned repeatedly throughout the document.\n\nMarketing info is comprehensive with Novo Nordisk as holder and several authorization numbers. Date of first authorization is explicitly '17 May 2024'.\n\nShelf life is '3 years' but also includes specific conditions after first opening. Storage instructions are detailed. Package description section has extensive details about the pen components and multipacks.\n\nThe legal category isn't explicitly stated but appears to be a prescription-only medication based on supply conditions.\n\nATC code is explicitly A10AE07 in the pharmacological properties section.\n\nManufacturers information is in both Annex II and the main text, both pointing to Novo Nordisk. Excipients are listed in several locations under different headings.\n\nThis appears to be an extremely thorough product information document. The instructions specifically mention that no field should be marked as \"Not found\" unless absolutely certain, which means even partial information should be included. The user likely needs this for regulatory or pharmaceutical database purposes.\n\nMy approach will be to work systematically through each field in order, carefully scanning all sections of the text for all referenced information. I'll be very methodical to ensure I cover everything, as missing even parts of the information could be critical in a metadata context.\n"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":31192,"completion_tokens":2331,"total_tokens":33523}}
