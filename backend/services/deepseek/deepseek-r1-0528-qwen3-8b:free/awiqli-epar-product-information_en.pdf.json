They directed me to act as a metadata extractor and analyze a provided text document. The text seems to be about Awiqli, which is a pharmaceutical product. My task is to extract ALL relevant information for each specified field from that text.\n\nFirst, I need to carefully read through the entire text provided and identify mentions of each field. The user emphasized that I must extract ALL information without marking as \"Not found\" unless absolutely certain it's missing. Let me start by identifying the document structure.\n\nLooking at the text, it's a summary of product characteristics for Awiqli, a medicinal product. There are several sections including NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT, PHARMACEUTICAL FORM, INDICATIONS, etc. The filename is given as awiqli-epar-product-information_en.pdf. The main fields to extract are filename, document type, product name, active substances, strength, pharmaceutical form, route of administration, indications, posology, contraindications, special warnings, marketing authorization holder, number, dates, shelf life, storage, etc.\n\nStarting with filename, that's directly stated as awiqli-epar-product-information_en.pdf. Document type is specified under the beginning as \"SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\". \n\nFor product name, it's mentioned as Awiqli 700 units/mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen. Active substances are insulin icodec. Strength is 700 units/mL in different pack sizes. \n\nPharmaceutical form is solution for injection in pre-filled pen. Route of administration is subcutaneous. Indications are listed as treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults. \n\nPosology section details dosing schedules. Contraindications mention hypersensitivity. The Marketing Authorization Holder is Novo Nordisk A/S. The numbers include EU/1/24/1815/001 to EU/1/24/1815/014. Date of first authorization is May 17, 2024... etc.\n\nI need to make sure I extract all variants and details. For example, the different pack sizes and their contents should be included under package description. Also, storage conditions mention both refrigerator and room temperature up to 30°C after first opening.\n\nSpecial warnings cover things like hypoglycaemia, lipodystrophy. I must include all such points. Similarly, for legal category, it's likely prescription-only based on the text mentioning it requires a medical prescription.\n\nDates: Only the first authorization date is provided—is there any renewal mentioned? Looking through the text, there's mention of long-term studies but no renewal dates. Probably leave that as not found.\n\nOkay, compiling all this into JSON. Need to maintain the structure with all extracted values, separating multiple entries with semicolons where necessary. Check each field against the text to ensure consistency and completeness. For example, excipients list is in section 6.1 with glycerol, metacresol, etc.\n"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":31192,"completion_tokens":1751,"total_tokens":32943}}
