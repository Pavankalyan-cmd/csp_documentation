The instruction specifies searching for 70 different fields across this medication document. \n\nFirst, I notice the document begins with the filename: awiqli-epar-product-information_en.pdf. That appears in plain text at the very top. No need to search elsewhere for this field.\n\nMoving to Document Type, I see \"SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\" is explicitly stated in Annex I. This matches the requested fields and provides a clear match without needing to search further.\n\nFor Product Name, multiple sections from Article 1 to Article 3 repeatedly mention \"Awiqli\" alongside \"700 units/mL solution for injection\". The excipients section also shows consistent spelling.\n\nThe Active Substance field appears in sections 2.1, 7.2.5 and excipients lists - clearly \"insulin icodec\" in multiple forms. Strength details are unit-specific across the listed pack sizes.\n\nWhen looking at Pharmaceutical Form, the introductory definition specifies \"solution for injection in pre-filled pen\" that appears consistently. Route of Administration becomes clear from section 4.2: \"subcutaneous use only\", explicitly stating against intravenous and other routes.\n\nIndications are detailed in Section 4.1: \"Treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults\" with type 1/2 explanations. Posology data is extensive in section 4.2 covering dosing, missed dosages and special populations.\n\nContraindications appear as \"Hypersensitivity to the active substance\" in Section 4.1. Special Warnings/Precautions have detailed explanations spanning multiple sections, especially 4.4 plus dedicated instruction leaflet and Ict's detailed use guide.\n\nThe Marketing Authorization details appear across multiple places: EU/1/24/1815 pack listings, Articles 7.1.1 and 8.1.1 showing \"Novo Nordisk A/S\" as holder with clear address.\n\nDates appear in the Authorization section: May 17, 2024. Looking at Annex II's supply conditions, they reference periodic safety reporting requirements with examples.\n\nShelf Life is Section 6.1.1: \"3 years\" with first opening limitations. Storage instructions appear consistently across the document especially Sections 6.5 and 6.7.\n\nLegal Category isn't explicitly stated as per instructions. ATC code appears as \"A10AE07\" in Section 5.1. Manufacturers data appears for Novo Nordisk A/S addressing both \"Hallas Alle 1\" and \"Novo Alle 1\".\n\nExcipients details are consistently listed in Section 6.1 and accompagnying appendices.\n"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":31192,"completion_tokens":1181,"total_tokens":32373}}
