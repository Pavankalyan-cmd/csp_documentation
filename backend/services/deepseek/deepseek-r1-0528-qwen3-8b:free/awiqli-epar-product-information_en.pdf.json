I'm dealing with a detailed text about Awiqli's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and need to extract information for 14 specified fields. \n\nFirst, I'll focus on the filename which is clearly provided in the header - awiqli-epar-product-information_en.pdf. That seems straightforward to extract.\n\nFor the Document Type, the text immediately mentions \"SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\" in the first section's header. This matches my understanding of what SmPC stands for - though technical knowledge about EPAR documents might be useful here.\n\nExtracting the Product Name is simple too - the first section 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT states \"Awiqli 700 units/mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen\". The active substance appears in section 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION as \"insulin icodec\", and the valuations are mentioned later.\n\nStrength extraction requires careful attention because it's mentioned multiple ways - \"700 units/mL\", \"26.8 mg\" and different packaging configurations. I'll compile all these variations that appear throughout the text.\n\nPharmaceutical Form is evident in section 3 - \"Solution for injection in pre-filled pen\" with FlexTouch, plus mentions of its physical properties. Route of Administration is clearly specified as subcutaneous use only in the description.\n\nIndications come straight from section 4.1 - \"Treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults\". But I should also check if there are variations in formulation specifically for different populations.\n\nThe Posology section (4.2) covers a wide range of instructions for dose adjustment based on different patient profiles. I'll need to extract all these details systematically, including those for special populations and missed doses. \n\nContraindications and Special Warnings are spread throughout sections 4.3 and 4.4 with valuable safety information. I'll need to consolidate these findings carefully. \n\nFor the Marketing Authorisation details, sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 specify:\nThe Holder is Novo Nordisk A/S with its full address. \nMarketing Numbers are listed in section 8 with the specific coding. \nThe First Authorisation date is May 17, 2024.\n\nThe Shelf Life (section 6.3) is clearly states \"3 years\", but there are more specific instructions about after-first-opening periods. Storage Conditions follow in section 6.4 and are thorough to extract.\n\nPackage Description appears mostly in annexes with comprehensive details about pen formats, materials and packaging components. Details are scattered but we can gather all options here.\n\nLegal Category information appears in the small print text about medical prescription requirements. \nATC Code is explicitly A10AE07 and tied to long-acting insulins. \nManufacturers are detailed in Annex II and broader details in the main text, mostly aligned with Novo Nordisk as the sole manufacturer appears. \nExcipients are listed in section 6.1 - glycerol, metacresol phenol, zinc acetate, sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid, and sodium hydroxide.\n\nI must be extremely careful to capture ALL relevant details without omitting anything, as the instructions stress. Each piece of information seems interconnected across different sections. Compiling this requires careful cross-referencing.\n \nLet me proceed systematically to compile each field, keeping in mind the imperatives to include all partial information and not mark things as \"Not found\" without thorough verification.\n"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":31192,"completion_tokens":1834,"total_tokens":33026}}
