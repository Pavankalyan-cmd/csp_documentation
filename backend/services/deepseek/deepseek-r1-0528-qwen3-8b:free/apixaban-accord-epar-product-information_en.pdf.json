The text is about Apixaban Accord's Summary of Product Characteristics, and the user has provided a very detailed instruction set.\n\nThe fields to extract are:\n- filename\n- Document Type\n- Product Name\n- Active Substance(s)\n- Strength\n- Pharmaceutical Form\n- Route of Administration\n- Indications\n- Posology\n- Contraindications\n- Special Warnings and Precautions\n- Marketing Authorisation Holder\n- Marketing Authorisation Number\n- Date of First Authorisation\n- Date of Latest Renewal\n- Shelf Life\n- Storage Conditions\n- Package Description\n- Legal Category\n- ATC Code\n- Manufacturers\n- Excipients\n\nThe user emphasized searching the entire text thoroughly for each field and not to mark as \"Not found\" unless absolutely certain.\n\nSince the text includes both parts (2.5 mg and 5 mg tablets), I need to extract information for both, as applicable.\n\nI'll go through each field one by one.\n\n1. **filename**: The text starts with \"filename: apixaban-accord-epar-product-information_en.pdf\" so this is straightforward.\n\n2. **Document Type**: The first section is \"SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\", so I should extract that.\n\n3. **Product Name**: From Chapter 1, NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT. There are two versions: Apixaban Accord 2.5 mg and Apixaban Accord 5 mg. I need to list both.\n\n4. **Active Substance(s)**: From Chapter 2, contains apixaban.\n\n5. **Strength**: For 2.5 mg tablets, each contains 2.5 mg apixaban. For 5 mg tablets, each contains 5 mg apixaban. There's also information on strengths like 10 mg mentioned in posology.\n\n6. **Pharmaceutical Form**: From Chapter 3, film-coated tablet.\n\n7. **Route of Administration**: From Chapter 4.2, Oral use.\n\n8. **Indications**: From Chapter 4.1, list all therapeutic indications for both strengths.\n\n9. **Posology**: From Chapter 4.2, detailed dosing information for various scenarios for both strengths.\n\n10. **Contraindications**: From Chapter 4.3.\n\n11. **Special Warnings and Precautions**: From Chapter 4.4, very detailed.\n\n12. **Marketing Authorisation Holder**: Section 7, Accord Healthcare S.L.U. and others.\n\n13. **Marketing Authorisation Number**: Section 8, multiple codes like EU/1/20/1458/001, etc.\n\n14. **Date of First Authorisation**: Section 9, 23 July 2020.\n\n15. **Date of Latest Renewal**: Not explicitly mentioned, so I should not imply it's missing; check thoroughly. In the text, only the first authorization date is given, but not renewal, so I need to be careful. The user's instructions say to not use \"Not found\" if not certain. Upon searching, no renewal date is stated, so I'll note that.\n\n16. **Shelf Life**: From Chapter 6.3, 3 years.\n\n17. **Storage Conditions**: From Chapter 6.4, no special conditions.\n\n18. **Package Description**: Chapter 6.5, various pack sizes.\n\n19. **Legal Category**: Not explicitly in Chapter 5, but in healthcare contexts, it might be implied. Mention \"See SmPC for details\".\n\n20. **ATC Code**: From Chapter 5, B01AF02.\n\n21. **Manufacturers**: From Chapter 7 and other sections, list all manufacturers mentioned.\n\n22. **Excipients**: From Chapter 6.1, lists lactose and other excipients.\n\nSince the response needs to be in JSON format, I should structure it with key-value pairs. If there are multiple entries, I need to compile them, perhaps as lists or strings combining information.\n\nFor fields with multiple values, e.g., Marketing Authorisation Numbers, I should include all listed.\n\nEnsure exact matches where possible, but extract as much as I can.\n\nNow, compile the JSON.\n\nFirst, filename:\n\n- Extracted directly: \"apixaban-accord-epar-product-information_en.pdf\"\n\nDocument Type: \"Summary of Product Characteristics\"\n\nProduct Name: Need to list for both tablet strengths.\n\nFrom text:\n- 2.5 mg: Apixaban Accord 2.5 mg film-coated tablets\n- 5 mg: Apixaban Accord 5 mg film-coated tablets\n\nSo I can put both in the value.\n\nSimilarly for other fields.\n\nDate of Latest Renewal: Not mentioned, but there's \"Date of first authorisation\", so I'll infer that since no renewal date is given, it might not be found. But the user said not to use \"Not found\" unless certain. I'll include it with the information I have.\n\nIn section 9, it's \"Date of first authorisation: 23 July 2020\". No renewal mentioned.\n\nFor Shelf Life, it's given as 3 years.\n\nNow, in the answer, I need to provide the information in JSON. Since there's a lot of text, I'll summarize by extracting key points.\n\nFor \"Indications\", I need to list all indications mentioned.\n\nFrom Chapter 4.1:\nFor both strengths: Prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) post-surgery, Prevention of stroke, Treatment of DVT and PE.\n\nSpecifically for 2.5 mg and full details.\n\nI need to extract without repeating the whole text.\n\nUse the JSON response.\n\nFinally, ensure the JSON has all specified fields.\n\n{...}\n"}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":69240,"completion_tokens":3153,"total_tokens":72393}}
